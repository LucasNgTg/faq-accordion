## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

React is great for creating modular components without clogging the HTML with repeated elements, though I do not understand why the index.html can only access files in the public folder.
